<h1 class='level1'>A Simple Compiler - Part 2: Syntax analysis.</h1>
<p>
Like Lexical analysis, Syntax analysis (or so-called parsing) is
a highly analyzed and well understood part of compiling.
Basically, parsing takes the symbols returned by the scanner and
makes sure that they form sentences (or productions) that are
legal, according to the languages grammar.
<p>
There are many different parsing algorithms,  some more flexible
than others. Some are more suited to automated parser generators
than others.  Well known parser generators include YACC, BISON
(the GNU version of YACC), Antlr, and Coco/R. We will cover one
algorithm - called recursive descent - which is well suited to a
hand-crafted compiler.  But before we get there, we'll need to
talk about grammars.
<p>
A grammar is a formal way of specifying the syntax of a language.
Developing a well defined non-ambiguous grammar is one of the
most important steps you can take to make writing your compiler
successful. The particular grammar format we'll use is called
EBNF, for Extended Backus Naur Form.
<p>
An EBNF grammar consists of:
<p>
<ul><li>Terminals - which consist of symbols in the language such as keywords and operators.
</ul>
<p>
<ul><li>Non-terminals - these are syntactic classes that can be substituted, and eventually lead to terminals.
</ul>
<p>
<ul><li>Meta symbols - such as '=', '|', '()', '{}', '[]' and '.'.
</ul>
<p>
<ul><li>Productions - this is simply a rule in the grammar.
</ul>
<p>
<ul><li>The start symbol - this is where the grammar starts.
</ul>
<p>
<ul><li>By convention, terminals are specified in quotes, and non-terminals are not.
</ul>
<p>
A production in a grammar takes the following form:
<p>
non-terminal = terminal non-terminal ....
<p>
For example:
<p>
<pre>
 sentence = subject predicate "." .
 subject = "Peter" | "Paul" .
 predicate = "writes compilers" | "crashes compilers" .
</pre>
<p>
This grammar has 3 productions. Sentence is the start symbol,
subject and predicate are non-terminals, and "Peter", "Paul",
"writes compilers", "crashes compilers" are terminals.
Additionally, '|' is used for alteration.  Note how all
non-terminals have to eventually be defined by terminals.
<p>
Valid sentences in this language are:
<p>
<pre>
 Peter writes compilers.
 Peter crashes compilers.
 Paul writes compilers.
 Paul crashes compilers.
</pre>
<p>
To specify a function call in a C-like language, we could write:
<p>
<pre>
 function_call = ident '(' [parm_list] ')' .
 parm_list = ident {',' ident} .
</pre>
<p>
The grammar above has two productions: function_call and
parm_list.  ident, '(', ',', and ')' are terminals, and parm_list
is a non-terminal.  [] and {} are meta-symbols, meaning
zero-or-one and zero-or-more of what they enclose, respectively.
Other meta-symbols are '|' for 'or', and '(' and ')' for
grouping. As you can see from the above simple grammar,
non-terminals in the production to the right of the '=' have to
also be listed to the left of the '='.
<p>
Note that by convention, ident and number are treated as
terminals, and are usually specified by something similar to:
<p>
<pre>
 ident = letter { letter | digit }
 number = digit { digit }
</pre>
<p>
Another common terminal is String, which can be defined as:
<p>
<pre>
 string = "'" {no_single_quote} "'" .
 no_single_quote = AnyChar - "'" .
 AnyChar = Chr(32) .. Chr(255) .
</pre>
<p>
function_call can be read as requiring an identifier, an opening
'(', an optional parameter list, and a closing )'. parm_list can
be read as an identifier, optionally followed by zero or more ','
followed by another identifier.
<p>
According to the above grammar, the following are valid function
calls:
<p>
<pre>
 <code class='funcname'>factor()</code>
 term(a)
 expr(tx, prec, tptr)
</pre>
<p>
The following are invalid function calls:
<p>
<pre>
 <code class='funcname'>1fun()</code>  --an identifier must start with an alphabetic character
 fun     --a function call must have '(' and ')'
 myfun(a b c)    --parameters must be separated by ','
</pre>
<p>
Another simple example.  We'd like to write a teeny compiler for
a subset of Pascal.  Our subset will only support one statement -
writeln.  Here is a grammar for teeny Pascal:
<p>
<pre>
  Program = 'program' ident ';' 'begin' Stmtseq 'end' '.' .
  Stmtseq = [Stmt {';' Stmt }] .
  Stmt    = 'writeln' '(' String ')' .
</pre>
<p>
This grammar has 3 productions.  Program is the start symbol.
Pascal, Stmtseq and Stmt are non-terminals. Note how each of the
non-terminal symbols is substituted for until it leads to a
terminal.
<p>
<pre>
  A teeny Pascal example program:
</pre>
<p>
<pre>
  program one;
  begin
    writeln('hello, world!');
    writeln('goodbye.');
  end.
</pre>
<p>
<pre>
  A erroneous teeny Pascal program:
</pre>
<p>
<pre>
  program;    -- ident missing after program
  begin
    write     -- unknown identifier
    <code class='funcname'>writeln()</code> -- writeln requires a string
  end;        -- terminating 'end' requires a '.'
</pre>
<p>
Can you see how the grammar above can be used to see if a program
is syntactically correct?
<p>
So how would you write a parser for the teeny Pascal grammar?
<p>
It turns out that the parsing closely follows the grammar.  We
assume the existence of a routine <code class='funcname'>getsym()</code> that fetches the next
symbol from the source, and stores it in the global variable sym.
We also assume the existence of a routine <code class='funcname'>expect()</code>, which
verifies that the passed symbol is equal to the current symbol,
and if so, retrieves the next symbol by calling <code class='funcname'>getsym()</code>.
Further, we assume that <code class='funcname'>getsym()</code> has already been called at least
once.
<p>
To parse the Pascal production:
<p>
<pre>
 Program = 'program' ident ';' 'begin' Stmtseq 'end' '.' .
</pre>
<p>
<pre>
 <code class='funcname'>program()</code>
   expect(programsym)
   expect(idsym)
   expect(semi)
   expect(beginsym)
   <code class='funcname'>stmtseq()</code>
   expect(endsym)
   expect(period)
 end
</pre>
<p>
Apparently, for terminals, we simply make sure they are there,
and in the proper order.
<p>
For non-terminals we call a function that handles the work.
<p>
To parse Stmtseq:
<p>
<pre>
  Stmtseq = Stmt {';' Stmt } .
</pre>
<p>
<pre>
 <code class='funcname'>stmtseq()</code>
   <code class='funcname'>stmt()</code>;
   while sym == semi
     <code class='funcname'>getsym()</code>    -- consume ';'
     <code class='funcname'>stmt()</code>
   end
 end
</pre>
<p>
Remember, {} specifies symbols that appear zero or more times.
<p>
The above could also be written as:
<p>
<pre>
 <code class='funcname'>stmtseq()</code>
   loop
     <code class='funcname'>stmt()</code>
     if sym &lt;&gt; semi break
     <code class='funcname'>getsym()</code>
   end
 end
</pre>
<p>
Finally, to parse Stmt:
<p>
<pre>
  Stmt = ['writeln' '(' String ')'] .
</pre>
<p>
<pre>
 <code class='funcname'>stmt()</code>
   if sym == writelnsym
     <code class='funcname'>getsym()</code>
     expect(lparen)
     expect(stringsym)
     expect(rparen)
   endif
 end
</pre>
<p>
Of course I am grossly oversimplifying here, but I hope you get
the general idea.  I also hope you see how important it is to
have a grammar, and how easy it can be to develop a parser from
that grammar.
<p>
A simple example implementation of the above grammar follows.
The example can run the above teeny Pascal program.
