<h1 class='level1'>A Simple Compiler - Part 5: Variables</h1>
<p>
<a name='introduction'></a>
<h2 class='level2'>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In Part 4 we introduced the Symbol Table and Constants.  This
article will deal with variables.
<p>
<a name='variables'></a>
<h2 class='level2'>Variables</h2>
<p>
Variables are used to store program state information.  Unlike
Constants, Variables can be modified during runtime.  We are
going to add simple integer variables to Teeny.  Later, we will
add booleans, characters, enumerations, and arrays of each of the
simple types.
<p>
Variables also have to be stored somewhere.  This implies that
the size of the variable is important.  In a compiler that
generates code for a real machine, alignment issues must be dealt
with.
<p>
Variables can also have a lifetime.  There are global variables,
which maintain their value throughout the programs run. There are
local variables, which lose their value when when the routine or
class they were declared in goes out of scope.  A stack is a
convenient structure to use for storing local variables.
<p>
Variables can also have visibility.  Typically, visibility is
limited to a routine, a class, or a module.  In some instances,
there can be variables that are always visible.
<p>
<a name='types'></a>
<h2 class='level2'>Types</h2>
<p>
Variables are often associated with a type.  Typical types are
character, integer, floating point, boolean, string and user
defined.  In Teeny .05, the only variable type we will consider
is integer.
<p>
As an aside, there is a long ongoing debate on static typing vs.
dynamic typing, and strong typing vs. weak typing.  The argument
goes that dynamic and weak typing make programming easier, which
the other side says that static and strong typing makes programs
more reliable.
<p>
For simplicity, we will only deal with static and strong typing.
<p>
<a name='declarations:'></a>
<h2 class='level2'>Declarations:</h2>
<p>
How do you declare variables?  We will follow a Pascal-like
approach, in order to make parsing simple.
<p>
<pre>
 'var' ident {',' ident} ';'
</pre>
<p>
This says that a variable is declared by the keyword 'var',
followed by one or more identifiers, separated by commas.  The
list is terminated with a semicolon.  Since we only have a single
type in Teeny v0.05 (integer), there is no need to also declare
the variables type. When we add multiple types to Teeny, we will
amend this production, adding the type.
<p>
<a name='operations_on_variables'></a>
<h2 class='level2'>Operations on Variables</h2>
<p>
What types of operations can you do with variables:
<p>
<ul><li>You can set their value
<li>You can read their value
</ul>
<p>
For integers, you can perform all the standard arithmetic
operations upon them.
<p>
It turns out that a stack (as used in our Virtual Machine) is
ideal for working with integers, and makes code generation for
arithmetic operations easy.
<p>
<a name='changes_to_the_teeny_v0.04_grammar'></a>
<h2 class='level2'>Changes to the Teeny v0.04 Grammar</h2>
<p>
Lines marked with '!' are new or changed:
<p>
Teeny v0.05 grammar:
<p>
<pre>
   Teeny     = 'program' ident ';' {Decl} CmpndStmt '.' .
   Decl      = 'const' Const {',' Const } ';'
 !           | 'var' ident {',' ident} ';'
             .
   Const     = ident '=' number .
   CmpndStmt = 'begin' [Stmt {';' Stmt }] 'end' .
   Stmt      = Writeln
 !           | ident ':=' Expr .
   Writeln   = 'writeln' '('
               [(string|Expr) {',' (string|Expr) }] ')' .
   Expr      = Term { ('+' | '-') Term } .
   Term      = Factor { ('*' | '/') Factor } .
   Factor    = number
             | ident
             | ('+' | '-') Factor
             | '(' Expr ')'
             .
</pre>
<p>
As you can see, we have added the variable declaration
production, and the assignment production.
<p>
Here is a sample Teeny v0.05 program:
<p>
<pre>
 program five;
 var x, y, z;
 begin
     x:=3;
     y:=2;
     z:=x+y*4;
     writeln('z = ', z);
 end.
</pre>
<p>
<a name='changes_to_the_scanner'></a>
<h2 class='level2'>Changes to the Scanner</h2>
<p>
The identifier "var" is now recognized.
<p>
<a name='changes_to_the_symbol_table'></a>
<h2 class='level2'>Changes to the Symbol Table</h2>
<p>
We already have a place to store the identifiers name and value
in the symbol table, from our addition of constants.  For
variables, we also need a place to store the address of the
variable.
<p>
A new routine, <code class='funcname'>enter_var()</code> was added to add variables (as opposed
to constants) to the symbol table.  <code class='funcname'>enter_var()</code> sets the
variables address, and then increments the the total space used
by global variables.
<p>
<a name='changes_to_the_parser'></a>
<h2 class='level2'>Changes to the Parser</h2>
<p>
Enumerated type var_t, and varsym added.
<p>
<code class='funcname'>factor()</code> updated to handle variables in expressions.  This mainly
consists of discovering that the identifier is a variable, by
consulting the symbol table.  Then, that symbol table reference
is passed along to the code generator to generate code to load
the variables value onto the stack.
<p>
We also have to account for new statements.  The EBNF for
declaring variables is:
<p>
<pre>
 'var' ident {',' ident} ';'
</pre>
<p>
This is handled in function <code class='funcname'>decl()</code>.  In pseudo code:
<p>
<pre>
 if accept(varsym) then
   repeat
     expect(identsym)
   until not accept(comma)
 end if
</pre>
<p>
For semantic checking, we make sure that the variable name is not
already defined.  Finally, we need to enter this variable
identifier into the symbol table, by calling <code class='funcname'>enter_var()</code>.
<p>
The EBNF for our assignment statement is:
<p>
<pre>
 ident ':=' Expr .
</pre>
<p>
This is handled in function <code class='funcname'>stmt()</code>.  In pseudo code:
<p>
<pre>
 if accept(identsym) then
   expect(assign)
   <code class='funcname'>expression()</code>
 end if
</pre>
<p>
We also need to verify that the variable on the left hand side of
the assignment statement exists.
<p>
<code class='funcname'>Expression()</code> places the result on the stack, and we call the code
generator to generate code to store the result in the variable,
using the symbol table reference.
<p>
<p>
<a name='changes_to_the_code_generator'></a>
<h2 class='level2'>Changes to the Code Generator</h2>
<p>
Added <code class='funcname'>load_value()</code> to load the value of a variable on the stack.
<p>
Added <code class='funcname'>store()</code> to store the top value in the stack into a
variable.
<p>
<a name='changes_to_the_virtual_machine'></a>
<h2 class='level2'>Changes to the Virtual Machine</h2>
<p>
The load (lod) and store (sto) instructions were added.
<p>
Load loads a value from a variable (in the stack) to the top of
the stack.
<p>
Store stores the top value on the stack into a variable (also in
the stack).
<p>
The interpreter now sets the initial stack pointer just above the
allocated global data.  This implies that global variables are
stored at the bottom of the stack.
<p>
<a name='summary'></a>
<h2 class='level2'>Summary</h2>
<p>
We have added variables to our simple compiler.  And, it turned
out to be amazingly easy.  So, what do we have?  We have a simple
compiler, that can create and assign variables, and perform the
standard arithmetic operations upon them.  Not very exciting,
except that by taking small steps, it has been very easy to get
to where we are.  Major reasons our journey has been so simple is
that we have based our compiler on a concrete grammar, and have
been careful to segregate the scanning from the parsing from the
code generation.  It also helps that we are generating code for
an idealized virtual machine :-)
<p>
Next time we will add a few control statements, which will allow
us to write some simple programs that do something a little more
exciting.
